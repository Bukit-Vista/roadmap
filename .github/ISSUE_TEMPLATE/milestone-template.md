### Description
Aims to increase the Review Conversion Rate to push the [5-star rating goal](https://coda.io/d/Chapter-and-Team-Management_dAzjTEwEvGp/Semester-5-Milestones-On-Going_suLb1#Monthly-Strategic-Milestones_tugAY/r63&view=modal)

### Problem
We still have low score of Review Conversion Rate (0.45 rate updated on Jul 11 2024 2:30 pm). It may cause the 5-star rating doesn't achieved the goal. ([data](https://datavista.bukitvista.com/queries/590?p_date=d_this_year#2177))

### Solution
Here is the current flow of guest status (confirmed by Sarah (GEM))

And here are some proposed action to encourage guests to give their review:

1. There is check-out reminder message but there is no narrative to encourage guests to give their reviews after they checked-out. We can **add the message content about the giving a review** there.
2. Needs of standardized partner training to ask guests for a review, If the partner is present when the guest checks out.
3. Put a kind of attractive brochure in the room property that contains encouragement for guests to give their reviews.
4. Current condition (reported by Sarah), scheduled message for remind guests to give review still often fail to deliver. We need to fix that messages failure.
5. In 2 weeks period after checked-out, we should ask the guest for the review routinely and automatically. For example one message reminder for every four days

**Requires Behavior Change?**: Yes/~No~
